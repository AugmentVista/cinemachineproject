Game Cinematics: 

Game cinematics was rather tricky for me as I came into it thinking that I was
more familiar with the style of content that to my suprise was a lot of new 
things to consider. Anything with lighting has been challenging as it is something
hard to visualize unless it is infront of you resulting in a lot more trial and error
rather than contemplation and calculation. 
Many challenges faced in this course have forced me to step outside my comfort 
zone unexpectedly and to my  benfit as I've learned not only some elements
of cinematics but things like how to ask for help when something just isn't sticking
or alteratively how to cope with your entire project nuking itself; no matter
the case this has been something that while tough I'm glad I put forth my best.
