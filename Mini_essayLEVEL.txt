Level design has been a course of ups and downs, most of the downs being unable to stick on one idea for long enough to bring it to life. 
This course has been a fast pace experince in what it means to truely bring something from concept to playable; although keeping things simple
seems to be very important as I've gotten lost in detail many times; something I am aiming to improve on. 
Overall the course is very interactive and fun while fast pace, the one thing I would change is having concept unlocked on brightspace from the start
so that students can better follow along the roadmap of the course.
